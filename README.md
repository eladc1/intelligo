# Intelligo


To run this small home assignment you will have to:
 1. Clone this project
 2. Set up and run the app by running `npm run letsgo`.

Project features:
1. All the assignment's requirements.
2. The data loaded by resolvers, so we sure the ui will not get loaded without content. 
3. Single automatically loader for the router.
4. All the schemes are cached and save unneeded http requests.    
5. The API url is saved as env variable, so we can control what API we are using in each env. 
6. Separate file for ts types, for smaller bundle & bandwidth.
7. Intelligo logo loader! ðŸ˜Š
 
 
What can be improved:
1. Tests.
2. Better and detailed types (less 'any' all over the place).
3. More generic helper components.
4. Better input helper messages.
5. More breaking point for better responsiveness.
6. And as always, much more ðŸ˜€.

 
 Thanks!
