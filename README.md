 4. Grab a cup of coffee. â˜•

Project features:
1. All the assignment's requirements.
2. The data loaded by resolvers, so we sure the ui will not get loaded without content. 
3. Single automatically loader for the router.
4. All the schemes are cached and save unneeded http requests.    
5. The API url is saved as env variable, so we can control what API we are using in each env. 
6. Separate file for ts types, for smaller bundle & bandwidth.
7. Intelligo logo loader! ðŸ˜Š
 
 
What can be improved:
1. Tests.
2. Better UI/UX.
3. Better and detailed types (less 'any' all over the place).
4. More generic helper components.
5. Better input helper messages.
6. More breaking point for better responsiveness.
7. And as always, much more ðŸ˜€.
